Although QAN had not directly used the Profanity project to generate the address, they used a project called vanity-eth-gpu, which had derived its code from Profanity and so inherited the bug. QAN is a layer 1 blockchain that claims to be quantum-resistant.\n\nThe thief stole 1.44 billion QANX from QANX's BNB Chain bridge, which they traded for 3,090 BNB (~$837,000) and tumbled through Tornado Cash. One minute later, they drained 1.43 billion QANX from QANX's Ethereum bridge, traded it for 255.4 ETH (~$327,000), and tumbled it as well. In total, $1.16 million was cashed out via Tornado.

You have to pay a tiny amount to register your message on the chain, which will cut out the vast majority of spam and bots. There is no throat to choke, so free speech is guaranteed.\" In another message, to the president of his Boring Company, Musk narrowed in on an amount: 0.1 Doge per tweet or retweet.

One such bot, known as 0xbadc0de, earned a windfall when a trader tried to sell 1.8 million cUSDC (USDC on the Compound protocol) — notionally worth $1.85 million — but only received $500 in assets in return due to low liquidity. The MEV bot, however, profited 800 ETH (~$1 million) from arbitrage trades surrounding the sale.\n\nOne hour later, a hacker exploited a vulnerability in the bad code of 0xbadc0de, which allowed them to withdraw all of the ETH in the contract: not just the ETH they'd recently earned in the huge trade, but all 1,101 ETH (~$1.5 million).\n\nThe bot operator subsequently sent a message to the thief via an Ethereum transaction, writing that if the thief returned the funds, they would give them 20% as a \"bounty\". Otherwise, they wrote, \"we will have no choice but to pursue accordingly with everything in our power with the appropriate authorities to retrieve our funds\". The thief replied by mimicking the message, writing, \"What about normal people who you have mev'ed and literally fucked them? Will you return them?\" and suggesting that if they returned all of the funds they'd extracted, the thief would pay them 1%.","themeTags":["Hack or scam"],"types":["MEV bots"],"techTags":[],"blockchainTags":["Ethereum"],"reference":[{"link":"https://rekt.news/ripmevbot/","linkTitle":"\"RIP MEV BOT\"","suffix":", Rekt"}],"time":"September 28, 2022"},{"title":"Someone claims to have burned a Frida Kahlo drawing to \"transition it into the Metaverse\" as NFTs","content":"A businessman has published a video in which he burns a drawing that he claims is an original Frida Kahlo drawing worth more than $10 million — though its value and its authenticity have both been questioned.
