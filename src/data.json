Although QAN had not directly used the Profanity project to generate the address, they used a project called vanity-eth-gpu, which had derived its code from Profanity and so inherited the bug. QAN is a layer 1 blockchain that claims to be quantum-resistant.\n\nThe thief stole 1.44 billion QANX from QANX's BNB Chain bridge, which they traded for 3,090 BNB (~$837,000) and tumbled through Tornado Cash. One minute later, they drained 1.43 billion QANX from QANX's Ethereum bridge, traded it for 255.4 ETH (~$327,000), and tumbled it as well. In total, $1.16 million was cashed out via Tornado.

This stems from the concern that the partial liquidation (20%, or around $21 million) would \"cause chaos\" on both Solend and the Solana blockchain more broadly. The proposal outlined concerns around Solend potentially ending up with bad debt, and liquidators \"spamming the liquidate function\" and potentially taking down the Solana chain.\n\nThe proposal elicited strongly negative reactions from many in the crypto community, who feel that a project taking over a user's account flies in the face of the concept of defi and sets a dangerous precedent.

Why did Occidental soldiers raid the Iraqi national museum of art and steal all of our cultural artifacts and history? Many questions to answer\". Moeef also accused those expressing concerns about her appearance of racism, and described them all as \"people who love the central banking system\". \"Big organizations come out to try to destroy my community of 90% women, mostly WOC like me\", she wrote.\n\nOne other TCAF featured guest, Ngozi Ukazu, withdrew from the Festival, writing, \"Not only do I disagree with the platforming of NFTS, but I also will not be a featured guest alongside an influencer who traces art and explicitly commodifies Black culture.\" TCAF wrote on Twitter that they were preparing a response to \"valid concerns\", and the subsequent day announced that they had rescinded the invitation due to \"code of conduct violations and the concerns expressed by the comics community\".","themeTags":["Art theft"," Shady business"," Yikes"],"types":[],"techTags":["NFT"],"blockchainTags":["Ethereum"],"reference":[{"link":"https://twitter.com/PINKCATNFT/status/1531447045277462529","linkTitle":"Tweet by PINKCATNFT","suffix":null},{"link":"https://twitter.com/PINKCATNFT/status/1531408366286688256","linkTitle":"Tweet by PINKCATNFT","suffix":null},{"link":"https://twitter.com/PINKCATNFT/status/1531345062172319744","linkTitle":"Tweet by PINKCATNFT","suffix":null},{"link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xGtPehhx1YSrQBmM6oAhR6bX-bZnFvkpOTkBCzNrsTU/edit","linkTitle":"Plagiarized artwork by Moeel","suffix":null},{"link":"https://twitter.com/ngoziu/status/1531282076187648000","linkTitle":"Tweet by Ngozi Ukazu","suffix":null},{"link":"https://twitter.com/TorontoComics/status/1531316472953421826","linkTitle":"Tweet by Toronto Comic Arts Festival","suffix":null},{"link":"https://twitter.com/TorontoComics/status/1531651817788125184","linkTitle":"Tweet by Toronto Comic Arts Festival","suffix":null}],"time":"May 30, 2022"},{"title":"Superlative Apes team does a \"slow rug pull\" after drawing in $2.9 million","content":"The Superlative Apes NFTs are a collection of Bored Apes derivative NFTs that feature colorful pastels.

They also sold most of their 8,888-piece Superlative Mutated Apes collection that launched in February, pulling in another 658 ETH (~$1.7 million at the time).

Additionally, a flawed staking contract required the team to have holders migrate their NFTs to a new contract — a slow and painful process that has resulted in most of the NFTs being \"stuck\" in a temporary contract. People who have questioned the project or accused them of rug pulling have been banned from the Discord and blocked on Twitter.\n\nDespite the team's repeat (though very infrequent) claims that the project is still going and is not a rug pull, this appears to be a classic \"slow rug\" — that is, when a project team engages just enough to keep the community from accusing them of wrongdoing, while still effectively abandoning the project. On May 7, a former community moderator for the project stepped down, publicly stating that \"the team has all but given up on the project, they come back every 4 weeks to put forth just enough 'minimal' (understatement) effort to not get sued\", and accusing the project team of not paying them as agreed.","themeTags":["Rug pull"],"types":[],"techTags":["NFT"],"blockchainTags":["Ethereum"],"reference":[{"link":"https://twitter.com/rugpullfinder/status/1523067487981502464","linkTitle":"Tweet by RugPull Finder","suffix":null},{"link":"https://twitter.com/cormNFT/status/1522851811186642944","linkTitle":"Tweet thread by cormNFT","suffix":null},{"link":"https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1470868594875584524","linkTitle":"Tweet by Dylan Field","suffix":null}],"time":"May 30, 2022"},{"title":"Another bug affecting Terra's Mirror Protocol loses the project $2 million (and counting)","content":"Someone has been able to drain more than $2 million from the Mirror Protocol in the Terra ecosystem.

Heavy botting caused gas fees to spike, and the project claimed there were issues with MetaMask's estimation of gas fees. Outside parties have suggested the issue was not with MetaMask, but rather with a poorly-implemented smart contract.\n\nPeople wound up making transactions that ran out of gas before completing, meaning they lost their gas fees and did not successfully receive any NFTs. Others paid sufficient gas, but ran into other errors with the contract that meant they didn't get an NFT. The spiking gas fees meant some people lost a considerable amount of money — people reported failed transactions that cost them amounts ranging from 0.1 and 0.8 ETH (between $338 and $2,700). Some who did successfully receive NFTs also claimed to have lost value as a result of the rocky mint, which they said contributed to a lower-valued NFT.\n\nmanifold.xyz, the group behind the mint, reported that they planned to reimburse people who lost gas trying to mint NFTs.

The new NFT project Kaiju Kongz decided to take advantage of the fact that you can pretty much do anything you want with a smart contract to ensure that the floor price of its project only increases shortly after the NFTs are launched. They released their project with a \"burn schedule\" — a list price that gradually increases as time goes on, where if someone lists their NFT below that price, it will automatically be burnt — the closest thing to \"destroying\" an NFT that's possible. This serves to ensure that the floor price stays above the minimum value the project creators want, which doubles daily from 0.065 ETH (~$190) on the day of launch to 0.64 (~$1900) on March 22.\n\nSome NFT collectors criticized the choice.

They used a flash loan to purchase a large amount of the vault's token, redeem the five BAYC NFTs, claim the airdropped tokens, return the BAYC NFTs, sell back the tokens, and repay the loan, all in one transaction that cost them nothing but netted them 60,564 $APE, which they then swapped for 399 ETH ($1.1 million).\n\nPeople were somewhat split on whether this could be classed as a vulnerability in the $APE airdrop, since (as with many crypto hacks and scams) the person was operating completely within the rules set out in code.","themeTags":["Hack or scam"," Hmm"],"types":["Bored Ape Yacht Club","flash loan attacks"],"techTags":["NFT"],"blockchainTags":["Ethereum"],"reference":[{"link":"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/138410/someone-borrowed-5-bored-apes-to-claim-1-1-million-of-ape-tokens","linkTitle":"\"Someone borrowed 5 Bored Apes to claim $1.1 million of APE tokens\"","suffix":", The Block"},{"link":"https://twitter.com/ahcastor/status/1504845020930654226","linkTitle":"Tweet by Amy Castor","suffix":null}],"time":"March 18, 2022"},{"title":"Australian regulatory agency begins lawsuit against Facebook over failing to address scammy crypto ads","content":"The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) announced that they had begun federal court proceedings against Facebook, alleging that the company \"engaged in false, misleading or deceptive conduct by publishing scam advertisements featuring prominent Australian public figures\".

On March 11 they began a vote, which lasted only three days, and allowed members of the DAO to vote on whether the project should close and distribute treasury funds to participants. Much like the Wonderland vote in late January, a relatively small number of whales with a large share of the votes (who bought in early and still stood to make money on the project) were able to pass the vote to close the project, despite a majority of voters selecting to keep the project going. Furthermore, because the Invictus tokens used for voting also themselves hold the value, some people were unable to vote in the poll because their tokens were locked up in lending platforms where they had used them as collateral. Many participants in the project who haven't been actively watching the governance page likely don't even know the vote happened.\n\nSome members of the project wrote on Discord that they felt rugged, with one even speculating that the project had been so eager to implement voting so they could pass a \"community\" vote to close the project and make off with a profit without damaging their reputations or potentially facing lawsuits. Various members of the project Discord shared how much they had lost: one person said they were down $20,000, another was down $75,000, and a third person reported losing $400,000. One person asked \"who else is in the 6 figure loss club\" and received three agreement emoji reactions; another person said they'd lost a year's salary. Some people already opted to try to sell their tokens early, worrying that the project leaders might make off with the treasury and not allow people to redeem their $IN; others waited in hopes of the redemption price being higher than the current token price; and some even suggested buying more $IN in hopes that they could make a profit if the redemption price is higher than the current price.","themeTags":["Hmm"," Shady business"],"types":[],"techTags":["DAO"," cryptocurrency"],"blockchainTags":["Solana"],"reference":[{"link":"https://forum.invictusdao.fi/t/rfc-allocate-funds-for-team-operational-expenses-third-option/467","linkTitle":"[RFC] Allocate Funds for Team / Operational Expenses + Third Option","suffix":" on Invictus DAO forums"},{"link":"https://forum.invictusdao.fi/t/inip-allocate-funds-for-team-operational-expenses-redemption/523","linkTitle":"[INIP] Allocate Funds for Team / Operational Expenses + Redemption","suffix":" on Invictus DAO forums"}],"time":"March 14, 2022"},{"title":"Discord compromise targets fans of the Wizard Pass project in a two-for-one scam that both accepted payments for fake NFTs and stole the NFTs that victims already owned","content":"Wizard Pass is an NFT trading community and package of various software tools that can be joined for a price: a collection of 3,000 NFTs gates access to the community.

The protocol agreed via community vote that they would cap the amount given to a single individual at 50,000 $JUNO to \"ensure fair distribution across the network\".

The project website described a \"groundbreaking partnership between Fellowship and the August Sander family estate\", apparently referring to their partnership with August Sander's great-grandson Julian. The NFTs were all distributed for free to the Fellowship community, which the project website boasted \"speaks volumes about the commitment of both Fellowship and the August Sander family estate to creating a new standard of visibility and public access to large photography collections, an issue that has historically burdened museums\". The website does not appear to mention that they take a 10% cut of all secondary sales, which so far appears to have netted them around 7 ETH ($20,000).\n\nThe problem with this whole scheme is that Julian Sanders does not actually control the Sander estate — it was sold in 1992 by Gerd Sander (August's grandson, and Julian's father) to the Cultural Foundation of the Stadtsparkasse Cologne. That group was surprised to see all of Sander's work suddenly being sold as NFTs without their permission, and submitted a legal notice to have it taken down from OpenSea. OpenSea complied with the request on March 7. After almost two weeks of stalling and deflecting questions about the delisting without even acknowledging the cause, Fellowship and Julian Sander finally released a statement on the issue on March 18. Sander wrote that \"a third party... claims to have certain rights in August Sanders' photographs\" but that he \"believe[s] the complaint is not valid\" and would be working with his lawyers to have the collection reinstated. As best as I can tell, it seems that Sander is trying to argue he is entitled to sell his great-grandfather's work as NFTs because he physically possesses the negatives, despite the fact that the Cultural Foundation owns the usage rights to all of Sander's work.","themeTags":["Art theft"," Hmm"," Law"],"types":[],"techTags":["NFT"],"blockchainTags":["Ethereum"],"reference":[{"link":"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/cologne-foundation-challenges-hauser-wirth-august-sander-864383","linkTitle":"\"Cologne Foundation Challenges Hauser & Wirth Over August Sander Estate\"","suffix":", Artnet News"},{"link":"https://twitter.com/the_gee_pee/status/1504963428611469314","linkTitle":"Statement by Julian Sander","suffix":null},{"link":"https://www.photographie-sk-kultur.de/fileadmin/user_upload/170214_PM_Der_Nachlass_von_August_Sander_liegt_nach_wie_vor_in_Koeln-Final.pdf","linkTitle":"Statement by the Cultural Foundation of the Stadtsparkasse Cologne","suffix":" (in German)"},{"link":"https://twitter.com/duckrabbitblog/status/1504078131950497798","linkTitle":"Tweet thread by duckrabbitblog","suffix":null}],"time":"March 7, 2022"},{"title":"Influencer Jake Paul alleged to be repeatedly promoting projects without disclosing his financial involvement","content":"Jake Paul, who is already in hot water after being named in the class-action lawsuit against SafeMoon, has now been implicated by YouTube detective CoffeeZilla in $2.2 million worth of undisclosed promotions for multiple different projects.

On February 28, he filed a lawsuit against the NFT marketplaces OpenSea and LooksRare, as well as the company behind the Bored and Mutant Ape projects, Yuga Labs. The lawsuit was filed only ten days after another former Bored Apes owner filed suit against OpenSea for allegedly failing to secure their platform.\n\nOn February 1, he was the victim of a phishing attack in which he lost the three pricey NFTs. He had agreed to trade one of his Mutant Apes for another NFT he was interested in, but he and the prospective buyer had to perform the transaction through a platform other than OpenSea or LooksRare because it was a swap rather than a purchase for ETH. Armijo turned down several suggestions of platforms by the other party, saying he was unfamiliar with them, and instead suggested one of his own choosing. However, the other party was still able to send him a trading link that appeared to be from the site he had suggested, and Armijo approved what turned out to be an illegitimate transaction that allowed the other party to take all three of his NFTs for nothing in return. Armijo alleges that although he quickly realized he'd been phished, he was not able to get OpenSea or LooksRare to freeze sales of the stolen NFTs, and they were flipped for resale within days.\n\nArmijo alleges that OpenSea and LooksRare have \"utterly failed to protect consumers or do anything to disincentivize or stop the thefts\" because they profit from each trade on their platform. He has also named the company behind the Apes NFTs, Yuga Labs, in his lawsuit, stating that they have not done enough to disincentivize theft by failing to \"monitor its proprietary and exclusive ape community by denying entry to individuals whose access is predicated on a stolen BAYC NFT\". Once again, my heart goes out to the judge hearing this case.\n\nIn terms of damages, Armijo states he has been \"deprived not only of the significant monetary value of the NFTs he owned, but also [has been] strip[ped] of his membership in the BAYC community and the commercialization rights he possessed in his underlying Bored Ape and Mutant Ape images\", and as such is seeking damages \"in no event less than $6 million\". Interestingly, the name Robert Armijo also appears as a defendant in SEC charges from June 2021, where the individual is alleged to have unlawfully sold securities managed by an organization also alleged by the SEC to be a Ponzi scheme.

The exchange had in August paid $100 million to settle a separate lawsuit from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in an agreement which had also required them to implement proper blocks to prevent U.S. customers from using the service.","themeTags":["Law"," Shady business"],"types":[],"techTags":["cryptocurrency"],"blockchainTags":[],"reference":[{"link":"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/founders-cryptocurrency-exchange-plead-guilty-bank-secrecy-act-violations","linkTitle":"\"Founders Of Cryptocurrency Exchange Plead Guilty To Bank Secrecy Act Violations\"","suffix":", The U.S. Attorney’s Office, Southern District of New York"},{"link":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitmex-to-pay-100-million-to-resolve-regulators-lawsuit-over-crypto-derivatives-trading-11628624960","linkTitle":"\"BitMEX to Pay $100 Million to Resolve Regulator’s Lawsuit Over Crypto Derivatives Trading\"","suffix":", The Wall Street Journal"},{"link":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/third-bitmex-founder-pleads-guilty-to-anti-money-laundering-violation-11646863210","linkTitle":"\"Third BitMEX Founder Pleads Guilty to Anti-Money-Laundering Violation\"","suffix":", The Wall Street Journal"},{"link":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-bitmex-employee-pleads-guilty-to-u-s-charge-11660002378","linkTitle":"\"Top BitMEX Employee Pleads Guilty to U.S. Charge\"","suffix":", The Wall Street Journal"}],"time":"February 24, 2022"},{"title":"Space Crypto game surprises its player base with new, disadvantageous tokenomics","content":"Space Crypto, a play-to-earn game that launched on February 15, announced on February 23 that users wouldn't be able to withdraw all their reward tokens, as expected.

The plant went from generating a total of 39,406 tons of carbon emissions in 2019 to generating a total of 243,103 tons in 2020, its first full year mining Bitcoin — the equivalent of the emissions that would be produced to provide electricity to around 35,000 households. The plant was operating at only 13% of its capacity in 2020, but has plans to increase its mining operations.

Many pressing for permit review were unhappy with the delay, with the Seneca Lake Guardian reporting, \"This delay from the DEC is not benign... Every day that Gov.

Apparently unsatisfied with this explanation, the community tried to demand the team use their wETH to repurchase $LOOKS, though it doesn't appear this has happened.","themeTags":["Hmm"],"types":["LooksRare","Tornado Cash"],"techTags":["NFT"," cryptocurrency"],"blockchainTags":["Ethereum"],"reference":[{"link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/looksrare-team-cashes-out-30m-in-weth-faces-community-backlash","linkTitle":"\"LooksRare team cashes out $30M in WETH, faces community backlash\"","suffix":", CoinTelegraph"},{"link":"https://bitcoinist.com/looksrare-team-cashes-out-big-on-staked-tokens/","linkTitle":"\"LooksRare Team Cashes Out Big On Staked Tokens, Community Gets Furious\"","suffix":", Bitcoinist"},{"link":"https://twitter.com/ZoddLooksRare/status/1493131828601171970","linkTitle":"Tweet thread by ZoddLooksRare","suffix":null}],"time":"February 7, 2022"},{"title":"SuperRare parts ways with its community manager over racist tweets, she hosts a disastrous \"apology\" Twitter Space","content":"The same week as bigoted tweets from an ENS director Brantly Millegan surfaced, so too did racist tweets by Ashni Christenson, then-community manager for the NFT platform SuperRare. Christenson, who is white, had presented herself as an ally to people of color and other members of marginalized communities in her work with SuperRare. The first tweets to appear were from 2011, where in several instances Christenson used the n-word when quoting rap lyrics. SuperRare quickly announced that they had \"parted ways\" with her, and Christenson tweeted that she had \"stepped down\". Unlike Millegan, who doubled down on his statements after they resurfaced, Christenson appeared apologetic for what she had written in the past. She expressed on Twitter: \"wish I got the chance to take accountability & talk about this\". She apparently decided to try to do so by hosting a Twitter Space, oddly called \"a warning to all web3\". The Space went well for her in the beginning, with several people speaking up in support of Christenson and condemning SuperRare for the firing, and with Christenson championing a project she led at SuperRare to highlight Black creators and expressing how upset she was over \"the situation\". Several commenters expressed that they thought this was \"cancel culture\" at work, and that web3 was supposed to be resistent to \"censorship\" and \"canceling\".\n\nHowever, as the Space continued and amassed several thousand listeners, several Black women stepped up to express that her apologies didn't seem genuine or self-reflective, and that the Space appeared to be little more than an opportunity for other white people in the web3 community to \"forgive\" her and pat her on the back, as she gained followers throughout. The women who spoke up immediately began to receive extraordinarily racist and threatening mentions and direct messages on Twitter from various people in the Space.\n\nAs the Space was ongoing, more of Christenson's past tweets surfaced, several considerably more recent than 2011, and none involving song lyrics: several that were racist towards Mexicans and one that appeared to be questioning the experiences of rape survivors. When one speaker asked how old Christenson had been when she made the 2016 tweets about Mexicans, Christenson initially dodged. When another listener repeated the question she answered that she had been 26, but that research shows that your frontal lobe isn't fully developed until you're 25... or something. As the Space continued, Black web3 community member mec. kindly suggested that Christenson end the Space and take some time to genuinely reflect. As more Black speakers expressed that they felt hurt by Christenson's actions, the Space abruptly ended. Although the Space was being recorded, Christenson took down the recording shortly after.","themeTags":["Bad idea"," Yikes"],"types":[],"techTags":[],"blockchainTags":[],"reference":[{"link":"https://twitter.com/SuperRare/status/1490762047377735684","linkTitle":"Tweet by SuperRare","suffix":null},{"link":"https://twitter.com/ashnichrist/status/1490806072927531008","linkTitle":"Tweet by ashnichrist","suffix":null}],"time":"February 7, 2022"},{"title":"Another project tries to sell music NFTs without permission from artists","content":"Following close on the heels of the disaster of an idea that was HitPiece, a new project called \"NFT Music Stream\" cropped up.

There are options for problem gamblers who are struggling to stop gambling in the traditional format: many states and countries require traditional casinos to allow individuals to \"self-exclude\" — that is, ban themselves from gambling at an establishment. Online gambling is more challenging, but there is software like Gamban and GAMSTOP that attempts to restrict access. However, posters in r/problemgambling have discussed the relative ease of finding online and crypto casinos not restricted by the software — particularly easy with cryptocurrency-based platforms because of the anonymity afforded by crypto.\n\nRegardless of whether they are trying to use blocking software or not, some people in the subreddit appear to be struggling with the challenges presented to them by cryptocurrencies. Some speak about gambling in cryptocurrency casinos, while others have realized that the behaviors that many people involved with cryptocurrencies simply refer to as \"investing\" are actually manifestations of their gambling addiction. One poster wrote, \"Realised yesterday whilst out walking my dog that i'd used crypto as a way to satisfy my gambling urges.

This also raises the question of whether BAYC themselves have a way to determine \"legitimate ownership\" of their NFTs, which in addition to being expensive status symbols also grant their owners exclusive perks including merchandising rights and access to events.","themeTags":["Bummer"," Hack or scam"," Hmm"],"types":[],"techTags":["NFT"],"blockchainTags":["Ethereum"],"reference":[{"link":"https://cryptonews.net/en/news/nft/2957969/","linkTitle":"\"Bored Ape NFT Collector Loses $2.2M in Phishing Scam\"","suffix":", Crypto News"},{"link":"https://twitter.com/toddkramer1/status/1476450669406175234","linkTitle":"Tweet from toddkramer1","suffix":null},{"link":"https://twitter.com/jmorse_/status/1476607953679491073","linkTitle":"Tweet thread by jmorse_","suffix":null},{"link":"https://twitter.com/AlexandraErin/status/1476598304863670272","linkTitle":"Tweet by AlexandraErin","suffix":null},{"link":"https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3v3ny/all-my-apes-gone-nft-theft-victims-beg-for-centralized-saviors","linkTitle":"'All My Apes Gone': NFT Theft Victims Beg for Centralized Saviors","suffix":", Vice"}],"time":"December 30, 2021"},{"title":"Blatant copy of Solana's popular \"Baby Ape Social Club\" rakes in more than $50,000 before being taken down by OpenSea","content":"A clone of Solana's popular \"Baby Ape Social Club\" project popped up on OpenSea, using the Polygon blockchain.
